# MediScan
This project is a Java Standalone Application which is implemented at the KJSCE Hack 4.0 2019. This project uses an open source tool, Tesseract for Optical Character Recognition(OCR). The software is built to upload the medicine tag in order to find out the use and the side effects of a medicine. This system helps patients to identify and verify medicines which have been prescribed and are with them for a longer amount of time.
